Analysis Process
-Data Loading → Import dataset from Kaggle.
-EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → using graphic visualization. Each graph includes an interpretation of marketing strategy, product development, and future market penetration.
-AI-Assisted Analysis → IBM Granite used to generate insights, findings, and recommendations from analytical results.
-Reporting → Summarized results into insights and recommendations.

Insights & Findings
-The Low category dominates the amount of data compared to the High category.
-The average price of a BMW is fairly stable at around USD 74,000–75,500, with little fluctuation.
-BMW's global sales volume is likely to remain stable throughout the 2010–2024 period.
-The best-selling models are dominated by the X6, X5, X3, M5, 5 Series, i3, 3 Series, X1, i8, and 7 Series.


Conclusion & Recommendations
Conclusion

The analysis of BMW sales data (2010–2024) highlights several key insights. Sales remain dominated by a few core models—particularly the X Series and mid-range sedans—while many models fall into the low sales category. Pricing has remained relatively stable, but market distribution shows a heavy reliance on Asia and Europe. Although SUV demand continues to rise, the adoption of BMW’s electric and hybrid vehicles is still limited compared to traditional models.

Recommendations

Focus on Core Models – Continue strengthening the X Series and 3/5 Series while reconsidering low-performing models.

Expand Electric & Hybrid Portfolio – Increase EV and hybrid offerings, particularly within the SUV lineup, to align with global sustainability trends.

Price Differentiation – Keep flagship models premium while offering more competitive pricing for entry-level vehicles in emerging markets.

Diversify Regional Strategy – Protect market share in Asia & Europe, while expanding into South America and Africa with affordable premium options.

Leverage Digital & Supply Chain Resilience – Invest in online sales channels and strengthen logistics to mitigate global market disruptions.
